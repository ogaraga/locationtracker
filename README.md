# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Documentation

This is just a developmental project, although it was successfully deployed on vercel for dynamism. We used React and vite for this project with normal javascript. We employed mongodb as our database. 
# Mongodb 
was hosted in our local machine(computer) instead of the cloud based. This is why if you are not connected on the machine where the database base is located, the data fetched from it will be fully at atimes. So, you need to connect to enjoy this project maximally.
# Componentations
we broke our project into components for us to get the best result. There are about 11 conponents with different results.
# ContextApi
we employ the idea of contextAPI for state management of our components. Passing of props were made easy.
# Routing
we applied routing vey well and the use of LINK instead of the href a tag.
# Backend
Our backend was powered with express and nodejs. we installed some dependencies like mongoose, dotenv, cors, etc to be able to work effectively and achieve a desired result
# Backend and Frontend
These two were powered and interconnected by cross-origin widecat.

# DATABASE connection/express connection
Before anything can work, we needed to initiate the express to connect the server and the database
# Frontend
we installed mongodb/mongoose to avoid roll-up error so vercel can resolve it properly
# VERCEL
our ultimate deployment host is vercel.
# Pitfalls
The project is with pitfalls and when it happens, pls you can correct and let us know so that we can learn and improve.
